(Financial Cybersecurity Bootcamp 2018)\nQualification Round The qualification round is an 18-hour long competition, from 18.00 of 1 March 2019 until 12.00 of 2 March 2019. The challenge is given as a VM image and the goal is getting the root access. The answer we needed to submit is a report describing the steps we have done in order to gain the root access.\nPort Scanning After setting up the VM and the network, we started by scanning the ports for services with Nmap. Nmap Scanning Result\nThe result is pretty interesting, as we found multiple services running, FTP on 21, SSH on 22, Samba, Apache web server on 27777 (and another one possibly on 80). And so we started looking at each service.\nFTP With further investigation, we found out that the FTP server allows Anonymous login, and there are 4 subdirectories inside: dressrosa, enieslobby, marineford, and punk-hazard (The challenge creator must be a One Piece fan for sure).\nFTP Scanning\nWe got inside by logging in as Anonymous, searched through the directories, and found a file called “.onepiece.zip” hidden inside “enieslobby”.\nDigging Through FTP Server\nWe downloaded it; however, it is a password protected zip, so we started the password cracker to brute force it and left it running. Dictionary brute force yielded no result.\nSamba For the Samba services, we listed the shares using smbclient and found an available share called “sambashare”. We connected to it and found 4 subdirectories: y, 2, 3, and d. (Must be the 3d2y reference from One Piece)\nSearching the Samba Share\nWe found a file named “qr code naja” inside “2” directory. It is an image file of a QR code.\nqr code naja\nWhen scanned, we got the text “KEY3 = 478”\nSSH Using enum4linux we tried to enumerate the users of the system and found 4 users, tester, john, loki, and franky.\nList of Users\nWe tried using hydra to bruteforce the password for all 4 users found, but none was found.\nWeb Server Initially, we couldn’t access the web server on port 80, so we started by going into the web server on port 27777.\nHomepage on Port 27777\nWe used gobuster to list the possible directories and pages, and found the following:\ngobuster Result\nNothing interesting in /images or robots.txt. ziggy.php however, is a directory with a file named “decode.txt” inside.\nziggy.php\nThe “decode.txt file contains Brainfuck code which can be decoded as “grandline.htb”.\ndecode.txt\nDecoding Brainfuck code\nAfter investigating for a while, we found out that “grandline.htb” is the domain name that we can use to access the web server on port 80, so we put it in the “X-Forwarded-Host” header using Burp Suite and accessed the site on 80.\nEditing the HTTP Header\nWith that, we found a jQuery File Upload Demo page, which we can easily upload a web shell and access the machine.\nUploading the Web Shell\nAccessing the Web Shell\nWe used p0wny-shell since it is interactive and easy to use (It can upload and download file through the browser dialog too!).\nWe dug through the directories and found a hidden directory on the web server on port 27777 with another webpage.\nThere should be another method to find this page, but we got the shell, so we could access and see everything.\nFinding the Hidden Directory\nWebpage in the Directory\nWith the shell, we could see the source, so we know that the page would like us to type in the creator’s favorite One Piece character, which is “Foxy”, then it would tell us that there’s the file called “bookie1223sa.txt” inside the directory (which we have already known).\nbookie1223sa.txt\nThere are 0s and 1s in “bookie1223sa.txt”, so we changed them to black and white characters and resize the window to show 48 characters per line and got the key “KEY IS 193”.\nReplacing the Characters and Resizing the Window\nAfter digging a bit further into /home/franky, we found the .bash_history with the password “3d2yhijinbe” of the user “franky”. franky’s Password\nPrivilege Escalation Our goal is to get the root access, so we tried to get more information of the system.\nLinux Version\nIt’s Linux Ubuntu 4.4.0-31, and there are LOTS of exploits available. We downloaded the C source of one, uploaded it, and tried to compile it. Unfortunately, gcc is not installed on the system, so we couldn’t get root the easy way. We thought we could download the same version of the OS and compile the exploit, so that we could send the precompiled binary to the system and run, but we found an EASIER WAY!\nPermission Setting on /etc/passwd\nYes, the passwd is WRITABLE BY ANYONE!\nWe used the following command to add a new suid user with the password “foo”:\necho \"IsCaptured:aaKNIEDOaueR6:0:0:IsCaptured:/root:/bin/bash\"  /etc/passwd Rooted\nAnd thus, we got the root access and the flag “KEY:alabasta” inside the /root directory.\nGoing back to the zip we got from the FTP server, we used “alabasta” and the password successfully extracted the files.\nInside, we found 5 images of Ace (One Piece character). And that’s all we have done and submitted in the report.\nPictures of Ace\nWe didn’t know that there’s another key in one of the images and only found that out later from the writeup by STH after the competition.\nAnd guess what, we got through to the final round! Finalists\nThe final round is going to be held on 16 March 2019.
